##This blog - RESTARTED

2019 is already almost a month old. A couple of weeks ago I updated most sections of my webpage realizing that I did not post anything here for over a year. I guess this fully meets the definition of laziness.

###Excuses?

None really. I published this page back in autumn 2017 at a time when I was super excited to play around with _pelican_ and _markdown_ for website building. However, I kind of lost momentum soon. Nonetheless, one of my new years resolutions was to publish more content on this page, at least on a biweekly basis. Obviously I already failed, but I try to keep up with it now. May time judge me.

See you

Carl-Eric
