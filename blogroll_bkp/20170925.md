##A custom domain

[_GitHub_]() pages are a great way to host personal, organization, and work-related pages. I recently moved my own webpage from [_weebly_](https://www.weebly.com) to [_GitHub_](https://github.com), however my domain (www.exploringmicrobes.de) was still linked to my previous _weebly_ page. The question I was confronted with was, how to move the domain and use it as custom domain for my _GitHub_ page? I outline the steps I did in the following. Please note I wanted to use _cloudflare_ as reverse proxy.

###Create a CNAME file

In the _GitHub_ repository hosting your _pelican_ generated page (I guess that equally applied to _jekyll_ pages) create a CNAME file only containing your domain (see below).

###Add you domain to cloudflare

Create a [_cloudflare_](https://www.cloudflare.com) account and add your domain (see below). The subsequent scan takes something like one, two minutes. You see existing records. Edit the entries so that there are two A records referring to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154, next add a CNAME record with www as alias resolving to your github page (yourusername.gitub.io).

###Change the nameservers of your registrar

Continuing the setup, _cloudflare_ will tell you how to change the nameservers of your registrar (for me _weebly_). Afterwards it takes few hours until nameserver changes are effective.

That's it, maybe the outlined steps are useful for people setting up similar _GitHub_ pages.

See you
