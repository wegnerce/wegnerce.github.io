##It happened...

... i finally re-did my little page. When I decided to set up my page, I wanted it to be quick and if possible visually appealing. I had a look into [_WordPress_](https://de.wordpress.com/), but apparently _WordPress_ is meanwhile a little bit bloated and rather slow, so I decided against it (although it is for sure a great platform). I heard good things about [_weebly_](https://www.weebly.com/), I also know a couple of colleagues using it and I liked the look of many _weebly_ pages.

Long story short, I picked _weebly_ and I was also rather happy with it. The online interface is really intuitive and within little time I ended up with a result I liked. However, after a couple of weeks I kind of hit a wall. Although _weebly_ offers plenty of plugins it is not so easy to implement simple things like code boxes etc.. I should definitely have spent more time on checking out alternatives besides from popular content management systems (but I didn't - my own fault).

As a result I started to look into static site generators. There are a couple of them out there, with the most popular probably being [_jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com/). As _python_ person I checked out [_pelican_](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and more or less fell in love with it immediately and you see the outcome of it in front of you.

In future I hope to regularly post about insights from my work, myself trying out new ideas in terms of bioinformatics, teaching, and daily life at a German university.

See you soon
