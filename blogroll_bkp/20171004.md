##Pelican is plain awesome

After moving my site recently from _weebly_, I'm still extremely satisfied with _pelican_ and _github_ pages. What I presumably like the most is the fact that _pelican_ is extremely modular in a way that you can easily incorporate functions. It's for instance extremely easy to activate and implement _disqus_ to add comment sections for blog entries and static pages. 

###Setting the stage

Ok, first things first, I wanted to add a _disqus_ comment section to my blog entries. I signed up at [_disqus_](https://disqus.com) and added my site. During the set up process you are asked whether you are using any popular platform such as _weebly_ or _WordPress_. _Pelican_ is not listed though (see below). I selected the last option (that is the "universal code") and proceeded.

Next I a configured _disqus_ to the best of my knowledge, adding basic information (see below).

Remember, that I selected the universal code option during the set up? The cool thing is that we do not need this universal code at all - yes no playing around with html or anything. We just need to add the variable DISQUS_SITENAME = "your_disqus_domain" to our pelicanconf.py, easy. _Disqus_ is simply hardwired in _pelican_ for a lot of themes. Check your theme folder and have a look at /templates/includes/footer.html. You will see _disqus_ is ready to be implemented.

###Fixing _disqus_ for _pelican-bootstrap3_

After re-building my site ([_fabric_](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/publish.html) is great when you are actively working on your _pelican_ page) I tested the now incorporated _disqus_ comment function, but there was an error saying that _disqus_ could not be loaded. Hm, how to deal with this unexpected obstacle? _Disqus_ works out of the box almost every _pelican_ theme. A quick _google_ search revealed that this is a known problem with _pelican-bootstrap3_. Following [these instructions](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3/issues/219) resolved the issue and... tada a comment section is included for all my blog posts - success.

See you
