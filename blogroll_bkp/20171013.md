##Oh QIIME my love

I did my master in a bioinformatics lab, I was the wet-lab guy, I did not get in touch with any coding. When I was still going to school I was coding a lot (especially QBasic and TurboPascal). However after I left school I kind of lost it. This changed when I started my PhD. When I got my first amplicon / ribo-tag datasets I was confronted with the issue _what next_? In our lab there was another, more advanced, senior phd student and he introduced me to _QIIME_. It was love the first sight. Working with _QIIME_ sparked my interest to familiarize myself with _Python_ (surprise, love at first sight again), which I used/use a lot to write, what I call "glue code" to customize things. The thing that I liked the most about _QIIME_ when using it first was that you can easily generate a lot of OK looking figures as output of your analyses - being it community profiles, rarefaction curves, or three-dimensional ordinations (I still remember the first lab meeting where I showed three-dimensional PCoAs from QIIME - it was great ;-)). Moreover, QIIME is for me a prime example for open source software being developed with a lot of input from the community in a very transparent way. Over the years, I used QIIME a lot and it is still is one of my "work horses".

###A matter of believe, or what about mothur?

When you are dealing with amplicon sequencing data there is of course not only _QIIME_. It is only a matter of time until you come across _mothur_ as well, and these two are supposedly the most commonly used tools for amplicon data analysis, besides from less wide-spread alternatives such as [_SILVA ngs_](https://www.arb-silva.de/ngs/). When you browse the web you find plenty of forum and blog entries discussing the pro's and con's of _mothur_ and _QIIME_ and often it appears as if choosing one is an almost religious decision shaping your bioinformatic future as microbial ecologist. Yes, I myself use _QIIME_, but if our lab would have used _mothur_ I would have probably ended up using _mothurs_. Yes, sometimes it is that simple, in my former department I was basically a matter of office - there were _mothur_ offices next to _QIIME_ offices and there were constant discussions why one is better than the other. Personally I think it is important to note that _mothur_ and _QIIME_ are fundamentally different in their conceptualization. _Mothur_ is a stand-alone tool with many re-implemented tools. The crucial point here is “re-implemented”, meaning that original tools are ported to C++ and optimized for speed, parallelization etc.. When you run the rdp classifiier or uchime from within _mothur_ you are not running the original code, but the mothur's team re-implementation of it. This concept gives _mothur_ in comparison to _QIIME_ a significant edge if hardware resources are limited. _QIIME_ on the other hand is first of all written in _Python_. _Python_ is in comparison to C++ an interpreted language (while C++ is mostly directly compiled), meaning _Python_ code is by default much slower when executed than C++ code. Moreover, _QIIME_ is in comparison to mothur rather a framework embedding a lot of tools but not re-implementing them. Given that _QIIME_ is written in _Python_ and given that _Python_ is really easy to learn, _QIIME_ functions can be rather easily modified and customized. _QIIME_ is developed by a rather big team, while _mothur_ is maintained by only two people (which is stunning). I do not want to say that any of the two is better than the other, if you interested in differences between _QIIME_ and _mothur_ check out the links below. Stay open-minded and if you have time take both for a spin.

###Raising the curtain - QIIME2

Enough jibber-jabber. Over the years the very active _QIIME_ developers added a lot of functionality to _QIIME_. With the most recent releases of _QIIME_ I started to have the feeling that it was getting a bit messy. I'm not sure when the actual development of _QIIME2_ started but the very first alpha release came out in time for [SciPy 2016](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2.0.1). Meanwhile, approx. 15 months later the _QIIME2_ development is extremely advanced and the current pre-release is 2017.9. So far I have not really touched _QIIME2_ but with this pre-lease I finally took a look. OK, let's have a quick overview of _QIIME2_ key features:

+ a plugin-based system to easily implement new functions 
+ provenance of generated data (probably one of the coolest new features as it supports reproducibilty and tracking of analyses in general)
+ multiple denoising functions ([dada2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) and [deblur](https://github.com/biocore/deblur), that directly refers to the ongoing ASV vs. OTU debate, more about that in a different blog post)
+ a new feature-classifier plugin based on supervised learning (also something for another blog post)
+ and many more...

###Setting up QIIME2

Alright, let's install _QIIME2_ and take it for a ride. Like _QIIME1_, _QIIME2_ is extremely well documented. Nevertheless, setting up _QIIME1_ could be a pain. Especially because of dependencies that required certain versions, which easily caused collisions with other software. Using virtual environments made this a lot easier. _QIIME2_ follows a new strategy. The last couple of years saw a lot of developments with respect to virtualization (e.g. [docker](http://www.docker.com) to name one). When I looked up the installation instructions for _QIIME2_ I was quite sure to find instructions based on a _Python's_ virtualenv/venv modules. But nope, [_Anaconda_](https://anaconda.org/) it is. 

_Anaconda_ is a _Python_ distribution focussing on scientific work and big data analyses. It recently became rather popular due to its [_bioconda_](https://bioconda.github.io/) software channel, which facilitates the deployment of diverse bioinformatic software - neat. Nevertheless, I was not fully happy when I read that _QIIME2_ makes use of _Anaconda_. I simply prefer virtual environments, however I can understand the reasoning given that _QIIME2_ relies on [211](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/environment-files/master/2017.9/release/qiime2-2017.9-conda-linux-64.txt) (!!) dependencies, including _Python_ modules, _R_ packages, standalone tools and general linux libraries. The _QIIME_ developers also over a _Docker_ image in case you prefer that over _Anaconda_ (true for me).

###Playing around

With _QIIME2_ set up I just started to play around. I had a look at the available tutorials, and I decided to do the ["Moving pictures"](https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.9/tutorials/moving-pictures/) one. If you are familiar with _QIIME1_ the transition to _QIIME2_ is extremely easy. When I started working with the files I had moment of panick when I came along the first .qza file. I thought "Oh no, a proprietary, closed file format. But of course I was wrong. _QIIME2_ produces two kind of output files _QIIME_ artifacts (.qza) and _QIIME_ visualizations (.qzv). What is really cool is that you can view both kind of files without a _QIIME_installation by just going to [https://view.qiime2.org/](https://view.qiime2.org/). This is a great feature for sharing data with collaborators. Both file types appear to be archives that contain always provenance information in form of .yaml files. _QIIME_ artifacts can be also grouped according to [semantic types](https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.9/semantic-types/) (e.g. FeatureTable or DistanceMatrix).

The "Moving pictures" tutorial is great as you get to know a lot of different plugins (e.g. qiime demux for sequence demultiplexing and sequence statistics), the command-line interface of all plugins feels familiar to _QIIME1_ and smoothens the transition from _QIIME1_ to _QIIME2_ a lot. As I have the feeling that I get carried away, I finish it off with some screenshots.

Here we go, hello again 3D PCoA.

The implemented provenance information will favor responsibility.

You can export figures from visualizations as .svg. That's a super handy feature, making publication-ready figures easy with some polishing for instance in _Inkscape_.
