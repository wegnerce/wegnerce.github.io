# How did I build this page?

Back in 2016, when I decided to have a private webpage as portfolio for my research, I settled on [_weebly_](https://www.weebly.com). _weebly_ was easy to use, reasonably priced, and offered all the (simple) features I wanted.

I do a fair amount of coding for my work in [_python_](https://www.python.org/) and came across [_pelican_](https://blog.getpelican.com/) in 2018 as an alternative to the widely used, static site generator [_jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/). I started to play around with it, checked out some [_themes_](http://www.pelicanthemes.com/), immediately liked it, and moved away from weebly.

_pelican_ is extremely well documented, if you are interested have a look yourself: [_pelican_](https://blog.getpelican.com/). 

A lot of the available _pelican_ themes look a bit dated, [_pelican-bootstrap3_](https://github.com/farseerfc/pelican-bootstrap3) does not. I used this theme as starting point/scaffold for my webpage and modified it a bit. For customization I took a lot of inspiration from this blogpost: [_Beneath data_](http://beneathdata.com/how-to/how-i-built-this-website/).

If you like my interpretation of _pelican-bootstrap3_, feel free to fork it. If you have questions about how to use it, drop me a few lines.

This page is hosted on _github_, free of charge. If you want to use _github_ to host your page check out this [_link_](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) for details.
