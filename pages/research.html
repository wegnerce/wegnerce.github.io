<h2>Microbial life in early industrial soft coal slags.</h2>
<p>What comes to your mind when you think about soft coal? Probably pictures of large open pits, square kilometers of destroyed landscape, soft coal as major fossil fuel, and you may think about soft coal being among the top climate killers causing a large proportion of worldwide CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>However, soft coal was (and is) not always exclusively mined as a fossil fuel.</p>
<p>At the onset of industrial revolution, in the early to mid 18th century Germany, low fuel value, but mineral-rich soft coal was mined at (an at that time) large scale to win valuable sulfur minerals such as vitriols and alums (Figure 1). These minerals were highly demanded, because they were commonly used in early industries as mordant and precipitant. Soft coal mines in the surrounding of Bonn represented the biggest of their kind for winning valuable minerals in early industrial Germany.</p>

<p><small><b>Figure 1: <i>Winning of alum from mineral-rich soft coal.</i></b> Alum from mineral-rich soft coal is won by a smelting-like process. Soft coal was crushed into smaller pieces to increase the surface area. Crushed coal was smoldered, yielding ash featuring already an increased alum content. Alum was subsequently leached out of the ash with water and the leachate boiled to yield crystalline alum. Alum leaching was a low yield process, one ton of mineral-rich soft coal was only sufficient to win 50 kg crystalline alum, while 300-400 kg of slag were generated as byproduct. Alum was valuable as it was used in multiple contexts in early industries. Nevertheless, alum leaching was rendered obsolete as soon as chemical engineering was able to produce proper substitutes.</small></p>
<p>Mineral leaching from soft coal was a low yield process, generating tremendous amounts of slags as byproduct. These slags were dumped without precautions in the surrounding of soft coal mines and alum factories. While alum leaching as an episode of early industrialisation is meanwhile almost forgotten, large slag deposits such as the "Red Hill" (Figure 2) shape the landscape in the surrounding of former soft coal mines and alum factories until today.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Given the rather high metal content (aluminium, iron) of these slags, and their acidic and oligotrophic nature, I got curious about these slags as environment for unusual microbial life. First community profiling revealed the presence of various uncharacterized taxonomic groups within few phyla.  These initial findings sparked my interest further and meanwhile I apply a combintation of cultivation- and omics-based strategies to learn more about microbes in this exceptional anthropogenic habitat.</p>

<p><small><b>Figure 2: <i>The slag deposit "Red Hill".</i></b>  The slag deposit, which is a result of ~ 50 years of alum leaching features a distinct red colour,  and a strongly reduced vegetation. A close up reveals the presence of partially combusted, and in parts still intact coal pieces, as well as millimeter-scale alum crystals. A nearby drainage-collecting pond features an iron content that is even higher than in the slags.</small></p>

<h2>Top down / bottom up carbon cycling in wetlands</h2>
<p>Top-down. Methane is a major driver of global climate change and it is a product of anaerobic organic matter breakdown. A significant proportion of anthropogenic methane is emitted from (artificial) wetlands. Microbes in wetlands are commonly exposed to recalcitrant organic carbon in form of complex polysaccharides and lignins. Methane emissions from wetlands are rate-limited by the breakdown of these carbon sources (Figure 3).</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Past and ongoing research of mine is driven by the goal of learning more about complex carbon turnover in artificial and natural wetlands. A more recent aspect of this research is the effect of environmental stress (salt stress, draught) on complex organic carbon turnover.</p>
<p><small><b>Figure 3: <i>Anaerobic breakdown of complex organic matter by methanogenic communities.</i></b> Dependent on the environment, terrestrial versus aquatic, complex organic matter originates from different sources. Complex organic matter is almost exclusively a result of biomass assimilation. Except for methanogenesis, all breakdown steps can occur under oxic and anoxic conditions. Fermenting organisms hydrolyse and ferment biopolymers to primary and secondary fermentation products,which are subsequently syntrophically converted to H 2 /CO 2 and acetate. Acetate and H 2 /CO 2 represent the two major substrate pools for methanogenesis.</small></p>
<p>Bottom-up. Considering the ongoing advance of global climate change (greetings to D. Trump aka POTUS), methane emissions from wetlands are expected to increase as so far buried organic carbon becomes more prone to breakdown. The only known sink of atmospheric methane and C1 compounds contributing to methane emissions are methanotrophic/methylotrophic prokaryotes, which makes them a prime target to learn more about natural mechanisms of methane mitigation.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I'm interested in methylotrophs/methanotrophs from environments exposed to naturally high methane concentrations (e.g. the surrounding of methane seeps, Figure 4), and extreme environments in general (such as the "Red Hill") to learn more about underlying mechanisms of C1 carbon turnover.</p>
<p><small><b>Figure 4: <i>Terrestrial methane seepage.</i></b> Geological methane originates from sources including coal beds and gas deposits. Methane reservoirs are usually trapped under compacted layers of rock. A release into the atmosphere is possible through small cracks, which arise, for instance, through the retreat of glaciers and thawing permafrost. Methane seeps are diverse, and among other structures, include small gas vents (microseeps) and mud volcanoes (macroseeps).</small></p>
